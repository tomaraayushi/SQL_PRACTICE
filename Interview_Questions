create table icc(
	team_1 varchar(20),
	team_2 varchar(20),
	winner varchar(20)
);

insert into icc values
					('India', 'SL', 'India'),
					('SL', 'Aus', 'Aus'),
					('SA', 'Eng', 'Eng'),
					('Eng', 'NZ', 'NZ'),
					('Aus', 'India', 'India');

select * from icc;		
Approach 1-
select
	team_name, 
	count(1) as num_matches_played,
	sum(win_flag) as num_matches_won,
	count(1) - sum(win_flag) as num_matches_lose
from (
	select
		team_1 as team_name ,
		case 
			when team_1 = winner then 1 else 0
		end as win_flag
	from icc
	union all
	select
		team_2 as team_name,
		case 
			when team_2 = winner then 1 else 0
		end as win_flag
	from icc
)
group by team_name
order by num_matches_won desc;

Approach 2-
with team_matches as (
	select
		team_1 as team_name,
		case 
			when team_1 = winner then 1 else 0
		end as win
	from icc
	union all
	select
		team_2 as team_name,
		case
			when team_2 = winner then 1 else 0
		end as win
	from icc
)

select
	team_name,
	count(*) as num_matches_played,
	sum(win)as num_won_matches,
	sum(case 
		when win = 0 then 1 else 0
		end) as num_lost_matches
from team_matches
group by team_name
order by num_won_matches desc;
